Graph RAG – Realtime Knowledge Graph from PDFs
Graph RAG is a simple, interactive app that allows you to:

Upload a PDF document

Automatically extract its content as a Neo4j knowledge graph

Query the graph in natural language, powered by OpenAI's GPT models and LangChain.

It’s ideal for building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines on top of structured graph data.

 Features
Upload any PDF and parse its content into a graph

Extract entities like Patients, Doctors, Diseases, and their relationships

Store and manage data in a Neo4j graph database

Use OpenAI GPT to dynamically generate Cypher queries

Query the graph using natural language directly from the Streamlit app

Perform semantic vector search on graph nodes using Neo4jVector
